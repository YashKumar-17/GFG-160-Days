This function attempts to determine if two numbers in the given array arr add up to the specified target. Here's the approach broken down step by step:

1. Find the Range of Numbers in the Array:
The function initializes two variables, low and high, to find the smallest and largest numbers in the array. This helps determine the size of an auxiliary array (brr) used later.
Iterate through the array, updating low and high:
low is updated to the smallest value encountered.
high is updated to the largest value encountered.

2. Prepare a Frequency Array (brr):
Create a new vector brr of size high + 1, initialized to zero. This will act as a frequency map for numbers in arr.
Iterate through the array arr and update brr:
For each number in arr, increment its corresponding index in brr. For example, if arr[i] = 5, increment brr[5].

3. Check for Two Numbers that Sum to Target:
Loop through the indices of brr. Each index i represents a number present in the original array (arr) if brr[i] > 0.
For each index i:
Decrease brr[i] by 1 temporarily (to simulate "using" this number).
Check if the complement (target - i) exists in the array using brr[target - i] > 0.
If true, return true, as the two numbers i and target - i add up to target.
Restore brr[i] back to its original value (undo the temporary decrement).

4. Optimization:
If the current index i reaches or exceeds the target, the loop stops early, as further pairs cannot sum to the target.

5. Result:
If no such pair is found during the loop, return false.

 bool twoSum(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        // code here
        int low=INT_MAX;
        int high=INT_MIN;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            if(arr[i]<low){
                low=arr[i];
            }
            if(arr[i]>high){
                high=arr[i];
            }
        }
        vector<int>brr(high+1,0);
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            brr[arr[i]]++;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<brr.size();i++){
            if(brr[i]>0){
                brr[i]--;
                if(brr[target-i]>0){
                    return true;
                }
                brr[i]++;
            }
            if(i>=target){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return false;
    
    }
