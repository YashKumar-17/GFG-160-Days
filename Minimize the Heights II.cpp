Explanation of the Approach
The problem involves modifying the heights of towers (elements of the array) by adding or subtracting a given value 
ùëò
k, such that the difference between the tallest and shortest towers is minimized. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach used in the solution:

Sort the Array:

Begin by sorting the array in ascending order. Sorting helps to systematically evaluate the minimum and maximum possible heights as we iterate through the array.
Calculate Initial Difference:

Compute the initial difference between the maximum and minimum heights in the sorted array, i.e., arr[n-1] - arr[0]. This serves as the starting point for comparison.
Iterate Over the Array:

Loop through the array from the second element (index 1) to the last element. For each index i, consider two cases:
Adding k to the smallest elements (from arr[0] to arr[i-1]).
Subtracting k from the current element arr[i] and beyond.
The above operation adjusts the heights of towers either upwards or downwards.
Compute New Maximum and Minimum:

For each possible division point i, compute the new maximum and minimum heights:
Maximum Height: The taller of:
The height of the tower before i after adding k (i.e., arr[i-1] + k).
The height of the tallest tower after subtracting k (i.e., arr[n-1] - k).
Minimum Height: The smaller of:
The height of the shortest tower after adding k (i.e., arr[0] + k).
The height of the tower at i after subtracting k (i.e., arr[i] - k).
Update the Result:

Calculate the difference between the new maximum and minimum heights. Update the result (ans) if this difference is smaller than the previous value of ans.
Skip Invalid Cases:

If arr[i]<k, skip the current iteration since subtracting k would result in a negative height, which is invalid in this context.
Return the Minimum Difference:

After evaluating all possible divisions, return the smallest difference found.



int getMinDiff(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        // code here
         sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
         int n=arr.size();
        int min_elem, max_elem;
        int ans = arr[n-1] - arr[0];
        for (int i=1 ; i<=n-1; i++){
            if (arr[i] >= k){
                max_elem = max(arr[i-1] + k, arr[n-1] - k );
                min_elem = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k );
                ans = min(ans, max_elem - min_elem);
            }
            else
                continue;
        }
        return ans;
       
    }
