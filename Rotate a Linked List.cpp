### Approach and Intuition:

1. **Determine the Length of the List**:
   - Use a pointer (`back`) to traverse the list and calculate the total length (`count`).
   - If the list contains only one node (`count == 1`), return the head as no rotation is required.

2. **Optimize the Number of Rotations**:
   - Since rotating the list by its length brings it back to its original form, compute the effective rotations required (`ope = k % count`).

3. **Perform the Rotations**:
   - For each rotation:
     - Connect the last node (`back`) to the current head (`prevhead`), making it circular temporarily.
     - Move the head pointer (`prevhead`) to the next node (`newhead`) and disconnect the previous head from the list by setting `prevhead->next = NULL`.

4. **Return the New Head**:
   - After completing all rotations, return the updated head (`prevhead`).

This approach ensures that the list is rotated efficiently, minimizing redundant operations when `k` is larger than the list's length.


Node* rotate(Node* head, int k) {
        //Your code here
        Node* prevhead=head;
        Node* newhead=head;
        newhead=newhead->next;
        Node* back=head;
        int count=1;
        while(back->next!=NULL){
            back=back->next;
            count++;
        }
        if(count==1){
            return prevhead;
        }
        int ope=k%count;
        while(ope--){
            back->next=prevhead;
            back=back->next;
            prevhead->next=NULL;
            prevhead=newhead;
            newhead=newhead->next;
        }
        return prevhead;
